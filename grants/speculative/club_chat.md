## Project Overview : 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  In the past few years, the technology and infrastructure of decentralization have made considerable progress, but the crypto world is still using traditional communication tools such as WeChat Communication. It is the same sisuation of crpto exchanges as people still reply on centralized exchanges  to trade cryptocurrencies.
  过去几年去中心化技术和基础设施都有了长足的发展，但是就像中心化交易所依然是加密货币的主要交易场所一样，加密世界目前依然在使用诸如微信这样的传统的通讯工具进行日常的沟通。
  同时也像uniswap打开了去中心化交易所的大门一样，我们觉得去中心化的通讯工具进入实用阶段的时机和条件也已经具备很成熟。首先是加密货币的用户规模至少在几十万甚至百万级别，技术上亦来云carrier为代表的去中心化通讯基础设施的日臻成熟，这为我们基于密码学、智能合约以及点对点通讯等技术构建一个去中心化、不受任何商业机构监管和授权使用的即时通讯系统成为可能

  * the timing and conditions for decentralized communication tools to enter the practical stage are ripe. 
  the user scale of encrypted currency is at least hundreds of thousands or even millions. 
  Technically, the messaging technologies is the underline technologies in every blockchain such as Substrate in Polkadot, Whishper in Ethereum, Carrier in Elastos carrier and it can be used to implement peer to peer messaging.. 
  Based on cryptography, smart contracts, and peer-to-peer communication technologies, it is possible to build a decentralized instant messaging system with ensorship-resistance, which means it can not regulated and 
  controlled by any commercial organization. 
  Censorship-resistance is considered to be one of the main value propositions of Bitcoin. 
  The idea is that no nation-state, corporation, or third party has the power to control who can use the network. 
  Censorship-resistance ensures that the laws that govern the network are set in advance and can’t be retroactively altered to fit a specific agenda.

  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $100k.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** $5,000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
